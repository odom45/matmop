# Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-11-15

MATMOP ("the App") is an offline-first content viewer. We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how the app handles data.

## Summary
- The App does not collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data.
- No account is required; there is no sign-in.
- The App functions entirely offline. Any network access is not used by the App at runtime.
- The App requests only the INTERNET permission, which is required by Android for WebView compatibility, but the App does not fetch any remote content.

## Data Collection
- Personal Information: Not collected.
- Usage Analytics: Not collected.
- Location: Not collected.
- Contacts, Photos/Media/Files: Not accessed.

## Third Parties
- No third-party SDKs for analytics, ads, or tracking are integrated.

## Children’s Privacy
- The App is a general‑audience app and does not target children. No data is collected from anyone, including children.

## Security
- Because the App does not collect or store personal data, there is no personal data at risk. All content shipped with the App is stored locally on your device.

## Changes to This Policy
- If we change this policy, we will update the in‑app page and the version on our website or store listing if applicable.

## Contact
If you have questions about this policy, contact: support@matmop.example
